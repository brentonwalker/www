Games I've stopped playing, and haven't beat. I do not plan on coming back to them.

- Braid (PC) (Spoiled the ending for myself after I rage quit. Probably won't finish it.)
- Cortex Command (PC) (If this had implemented online multiplayer, it would have been fantastic)
- Crysis Warhead (PC) (Crysis 2 and 3 came out and this got left in the dust.)
- Darksiders (PC) (DS2 looks like a better game. Couldn't handle the little I played here.)
- Dead Space (PC) (Just not a horror fan.)
- Dead Space 2 (PC) (See Dead Space)
- Dead Space 3 (PC) (See Dead Space 2 & 3)
- Cave Story (PC) (Great game, too long for me to finish)
