What I'm playing currently, or haven't beat yet. I'm probably playing too many things.

- DmC (PC) (Probably my second favorite action game ever. GoW III still holding #1 spot)
- The Last of Us (PS3) (Greatest game intro ever. Depressing. Slogging through it, but it IS brilliant)
- Brothers A Tale of Two Sons (PC) (Actually funner with two people. Wish they would have included a second player option for those who wanted it. Better than sharing a controller.)
- GTA V (PS3) (It is what it is)
- Guild Wars 2 (PC) (Excellent MMO that I want to love more than I do.)
- Deadlight (PC) (Great little zombie sidescroller with a unique setting)
- Splinter Cell Blacklist (PC) (Fun co-op)
- Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag (PC) (Early, but may be the best AC yet)
- Dishonored (PC) (Beat on low chaos, but hitting the DLC. Top 3 GOTY)
- Borderlands 2 (PC) (Solid. Not revolutionary, but lots of fun. Wish I had 4 to play it.)
- Diablo III (PC) (Revisiting this. Trying to beat Inferno.)
- Dota 2 (PC) (This will probably never leave this list.)
- Saints Row IV (PC) (I'm a horrible person. I know.)
