Games I've completed and am not currently playing

- Chrono Trgger (SNES) (The Greatest game of all time.)
- The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim (PC) (One of the greatest games of all time.)
- 
- Assassins Creed (Xbox 360) (The beginning of a franchise)
- Assassins Creed II (PS3) (Better than the first)
- Assassins Creed II Brotherhood (PS3) (Best in the series before IV came along)
- Assassins Creed II Revelations (PS3) (A Letdown after brotherhood, but still good)
- Assassins Creed III (PS3) (Technically a great game, I just didn't love the story or a lot of the design choices)
