My main backlog. Will consistently be huge. I may have started some of these, but they're on the backburner currently.

- Fallout: New Vegas (PC) (Lost save near the end. Really need to finish this.)
- Side Meier's Civilization V (PC) (Endless time sink. Just picked up Brave New World. Will revisit this and play a few games when not in school.)
- Godus (PC) (Want this to be good. I miss my Black and White)
- Fez (PC) (Have made good progress, just need to start it up again)
- Guacamelee (PC) (Started this. Gameplay was unremarkable, but well-balanced. Theme of the game makes it worthwhile.)
- Fable III (PC) (Lost a save, but want to finish this up. Restarting is rough)
- Dust: An Elysian Tail (PC) (Great sidescroller)
- Metro 2033 (PC) (Lost a save. Want to finish this, may get moved to abandoned depending on Last light's fun factor)
- Metro Last Light (PC) (Got on sale, looks amazing graphically)
- Rome II Total War (PC) (Loved previous Total Wars. Need to make time for this)
- Hitman Absolution (PC) (about 50% done)
