What I'm playing currently, or haven't beat yet. I'm probably playing too many things.

- Divinity: Original Sin (PC) (Surprise of the year. Absolutely love this co-op RPG.)
- Shovel Knight (PC) (Dripping and oozing with nostalgia. Fun. Not inovative.)
- Payday 2 (PC) (4 player co-op done....ok. It's just not as fun as I want it to be. Still lots of good things here)
- Watch_dogs (PC) (Disappointing so far.)
- Don't Starve (PC) (Really liking the simplicity of this survival gem. Can't wait for multiplayer)
- Rayman Legends (PC) (One of the best platformers of the last 10 years.)
- Shadowrun Returns (PC) (I really love this game. I wish it had voice acting, and it would be just about perfect)
- Dark Souls II (PC) (I don't get all the hype, but I still think it's a great game, just not GOTY. )
- Tesla Effect (PC) (Arguably the game that got me into games was a Tex Murphey one. High hopes for this long-in-the-works sequel. )
- Broken Age (PC) (Already in love with this after 30 minutes. Not as great as I initially thought, but hoping that act II can deliever.)
- Guild Wars 2 (PC) (Excellent MMO that I want to love more than I do.)
- Splinter Cell Blacklist (PC) (Fun co-op. Probably second best splinter cell game.)
- Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag (PC) (Absolutely great combination of all things AC. Massive. Need time to finish.)
- Borderlands 2 (PC) (Solid. Not revolutionary, but lots of fun. Wish I had 4 to play it.)
- Rome II Total War (PC) (Put in about 2 hours so far. Not sure if it's as good as the "fall of the samurai" expansion for Shogun 2. Still enjoying what I've played, but not really a big step forward for the series.)
- The Walking Dead: 400 Days (PC)
- Dota 2 (PC) (This will probably never leave this list. My most played game of all time)
