Games I've stopped playing, and haven't beat. I do not plan on coming back to them.

- Torchlight 2 (PC) (PROBABLY abandoned. We'll see if I have much desire to return to it. It's good, but just not quite as polished as D3 which deserves more time.)
- Braid (PC) (Spoiled the ending for myself after I rage quit. Probably won't finish it.)
- Cortex Command (PC) (If this had implemented online multiplayer, it would have been fantastic)
- Crysis Warhead (PC) (Crysis 2 and 3 came out and this got left in the dust.)
- Darksiders (PC) (DS2 looks like a better game. Couldn't handle the little I played here.)
- Dead Space (PC) (Just not a horror fan.)
- Dead Space 2 (PC) (See Dead Space)
- Dead Space 3 (PC) (See Dead Space 2 & 3)
- Cave Story (PC) (Great game, too long for me to finish)
- Company of Heroes (PC) (Played this multiplayer for ~20 hours. Never got into the campaign. Fun game, not as good as many think it was though. Age II and SC2 are better games for their times. CoH sorta filled the gap.)
- Far Cry 2 (PC) (The world was pretty brutal here. I didn't care too much for the story either. Good design principles were much better in Far Cry 3. The ending was pretty garbage from what I later saw. Glad I dumped it)
- Dragon Age: Origins (PC) (I really want to finish this someday. It's just too intimidating. It's on the back-back burner so I'm not counting on it.)
- Just Cause 2 (PC) (No, I'm not going to beat the story. The game is fantastic to just play around with, however. Co-op mod was absolutely mind blowing.)
- Red Faction Guerrilla (PC)
- Natural Selection 2 (PC)
- Dirt 2 (PC)
- Resident Evil V (PC)
- The Longest Journey (PC)
- Cortex Command (PC)
- Plants Vs. Zombies (PC)
- Amnesia: The Dark Descent (PC) (Scariest game I've ever played)
- Age of Empires I (PC)
- Age of Empires II (PC)
- Age of Empires III (PC) (I still put some hours in this from time to time. No where near as good as Starcraft in terms of depth)
- Magicka (PC)
- GTA: Episodes from Liberty City (PC)
- Battlefield 2 (PC)
- Ghostbusters (PC)
- Mafia II (PC)

- Wargame: European Esclation (PC)
- Dark Souls (PC)
- Rage (PC)
- Anno 2070 (PC)

- Final Fantasy XII (PS2)
