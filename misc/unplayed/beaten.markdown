Games I've completed and am not currently playing

- Chrono Trgger (SNES) (The Greatest game of all time. ☆☆☆☆☆)
- Journey (PS3) (Top 10 game of all time. )
- The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim (PC) (One of the greatest games of all time.)
- Assassins Creed (Xbox 360) (The beginning of a franchise)
- Flower (PS3) (The best non-game I've played. )
- Assassins Creed II (PS3) (Better than the first)
- Assassins Creed II Brotherhood (PS3) (Best in the series before IV came along)
- Assassins Creed II Revelations (PS3) (A Letdown after brotherhood, but still good)
- Assassins Creed III (PS3) (Technically a great game, I just didn't love the story or a lot of the design choices)
- Alice Madness Returns (PC) (Great PhysX implementation and insane art direction. Level design became reptetive, but was a solid game overall)
- Katamari Damacy (PS3) (Absolutely the quirkiest game I've ever played. I revist it every few years. Soundtrack is sonic cocaine)
- Shogun 2 Total War (PC) (A little clunky, but great game. Fall of the Samurai is when it shines the most.)
- Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands (GC) (One of my greatest implementations of a 'rewind' mechanic or time manipulation in any game ever)
- Back to the Future: The Game (PC) (Underwhelming and somehat disappointing. A valiant effort to appease fans. Episode 3/5 "Citizen Brown" was the best episode.)
- Borderlands (PC) (Classic. Started a trend and took a risk. I put at least 60 hours into this game. I really loved the halloween expansion for some reason.)
- Batman Arkham City (PC) (One of the greatest fighting systems in any game ever. Rivals GoW III and DmC. The story and everything else about this was fantastic. A modern classic.)
- Batman Arkham Asylum (PS3) (Really a solid game. Improved upon in every way in Arkham City, but this was pertty near perfect for what it was. A pleasant surprise at the time.)
Max Payne (PC) (Loved it for the bullet time. Was still great when I replayed it 10 years later)
Max Payne 2 (PC) (Not as memorable as the first, but a must for fans of the noire style. Enjoyed it almost as much)
- Max Payne 3 (PC) (A different ball game from the first two. Wonderfully produced. The story was a bit strangely paced and uneven. Gameplay wasn't amazing, but was still fun. Some missed opportunities.)
- Battlefield 3 (PC) (Forgettable singleplayer. Put almost 250 hours into the multiplayer. Before Dota 2, this was my most played game ever. Absolutely fantastic multiplayer. Some incredible and unforgettable moments.)
- Bioshock (PC) (I liked it, but didn't love it. It was an important game for its console generation, but it wasn't a miracle like many thought it was. Latter half was less exciting than the first. No crescendo)
- Bioshock Infinite (PC) (I love and hate this game. It had way too much dissonance for the plot and mechanics to jive. The premise and writing was generally great, and gunplay enjoyable, if not simple. Overall worthwihle. Burial at Sea wrapped up everything nicely. The first was uneventful, but the second sure was great. )
- Crysis (PC) (Gorgeous and amazing level design early on. Later it got a little boring. The suit made the gunplay worthwhile. Revolutionary thoughts. AAA pushing things and I loved it.)
- Crysis 2 (PC) (Really well produced. Surprisingly long game that had a lackluster pacing of what could have been a better told story. Amazingly good looking. A lot of fun, but felt a little too much like plastic controls)
- Crysis 3 (PC) (The biggest letdown of the 3 Crysis games while being the best looking and most polished for what it was. This was probalby the reason it was so short. it was tiny compared to the first two. Extremely short and sweet.)
- Mass Effect (PC) (It's a very close toss up between this and ME2 for being my favorites of the series. ME was just so amazingly unexpected. I love the quirky nature of it. It didn't know what it was starting and was the most humble and niche of the 3 ME games.)
- DmC (PC) (Probably my second favorite action game ever. GoW III still holding #1 spot. Story wasn't great. Thought the ending was pretty stupid. Some of the dialog was fun and interesting. 60 fps version on PC was great, some uninspired level design)
- Ridiculous Fishing (Android) (Redneck fishing with a twist. Progression on the store was a little unbalanced, but the items were good. Didn't last long enough once you started to feel like you were getting 'powerful' )
- NBA 2k13 (PC) (Despite being an inferior version, I enjoy the 2k pc series. It's not amazing, but the character progression is well balanced. Needs polish and production values to increase to really be special.)
- Sins of a Solar Empire: Rebellion (PC) (If only this were made by Fireaxis. I want this to have a sequel, but with a more polished touch. 30 hours was enough to see all that the AI had to offer. I want a deeper, Civ version of this.)
- Portal (PC) (Classic. I loved this, but it's definitely the lesser game when compared to Portal 2. It has inspired many design ideas in my head)
- Portal 2 (PC) (One of the best games ever made. Perfect blend of style, humor, story, puzzle and balance. It's hard to argue with how well Valve pulled this one off.)
- Witcher 2 (PC) (I still don't understand the story, and generally didn't care about the characters, but the combat and graphics were great. When I played, there wasn't the currently implemented tutorial, which I'm sure helped answer a lot of questions. I think the linearity of the early game is pretty unattractive, but it opens up quickly. I'd love to play the 'second' path of the second act someday, but I doubt I'll have time.)
- Left 4 Dead 2 (PC) (Fun co-op shooter that I wish had a few more options. Ultimately it felt a little too arcadey for my tastes. I wanted something deeper, with more progression. That isn't to say that Valve didn't pull this one off. A very well executed production overall.)
- Deus Ex: Human Revolution (PC) (One of the greats of the last 10 years. A little wonky in some areas, such as the boss fights,  but overall was a fantastic balance of choice and gunplay. The designers really encouraged stealth and the gunplay isn't amazing. I want to try this again when the director's edition lets me carry over my praxis points to a second playthrough. Endings were a let down, but not a deal breaker.)
- XCOM Enemy Unknown (PC) (A surprisingly awesome game. Not that advanced, yet magically addicting. I really really hoped for some kind of co-op mode. I know it would be possible with cautious design. It works in Fireaxis' other turn based game - Civ V. Will try the expansion when its cheap enough. Wish I had an android version. )
- XCOM Enemy Within (PC) (A vast improvement on top of an already great game. My only remainning request is some kind of co-op. The mech and augmentations are a wonderful addition. Balance is impressively on par with the first game. Enough content to warrant another play through.)

- Final Fantasy VIII (PSX)
- Final Fantasy X (PS2) (Looking forward to someday playing the remake. Tied for second favorite FF - along with FF8)
- Heavy Rain (PS3) (I really loved this. Some weirdness and unnecessary design and story elements, but overall a game changer)
- Beyond: Two Souls (PS3) (Good, but disappointing after Heavy Rain. I expected more from Qauntic)
- Bastion (PC) (A very solid production. I didn't agree with some of the balancing at times, but overall a very good game. Music/narration was the star, followed closely by the visual theming. Both were excellent. The combat felt tedious at times, but was still inventive. Story was a bit of a mishmash, but was at least coherent)
- The Last of Us (PS3) (Greatest game intro ever. A depressing slog, with important lessons in pace, narrative progression, and character development. Time will tell if the ending tried too hard or if it was actually brilliant.)
- Brothers A Tale of Two Sons (PC) (Actually funner with two people. Wish they would have included a second player option for those who wanted it. Absolutely wonderful game. Puzzles are simplistic, but the story and visuals are just great. One of my favorites of 2013.)
- Deadlight (PC) (Great little zombie sidescroller with a unique setting. Seems to have missed some potential, however. Story attempted to go big, but fell flat. Still fun and worth playing.)
- Guacamelee (PC) ( Gameplay started unremarkable, but became excellent about 2/3 of the way through. Well-balanced. Theme of the game makes it worthwhile. Some frustrating parts, with little direction. Overall, a very solid and worthwhile platformer. Too bad it was heavily back-loaded with the good stuff. )
- Hotline Miami (PC) (Infuriatingly good. Story/setting was rich.)
- Remember Me (PC) (Absolutely wonderful setting, sound, and production values. Mediocre and rigid fighting mechanics, and a whiney, angsty story hurt an otherwise original and interesting premise. )
- Metal Gear Solid Revengance (PC) (Insane. Ridiculous. Not my favorite fighting system, but frantic enough.)
- TitanFall (PC) (One of the best shooters in years. Frantic and fun. Horrible story execution, but it doesn't matter.)
- Diablo III (PC) (3 x level 70s. All the rifts and bounties are fun but wearing thin. )
- Dishonored (PC) (The DLC was delicious. Not as good as the main game, but it had some really interesting improvements. Really wish it had more room to stretch its legs. Top 3 GOTY 2012)
