My main backlog. Will consistently be huge. I may have started some of these, but they're on the backburner currently.

- Thief (PC) (Proves just how good dishnored was and how hard it is to immitate)
- Among the Sleep (PC) (kickstarted, but am less interested now. Maybe i'll get to it eventually)
- Fallout: New Vegas (PC) (Lost save near the end. Really need to finish this. A really fantastic game. Really deserves higher praise.)
- Company of Heroes 2 (PC)
- The Walking Dead: Season 2 (PC)
- Saints Row IV (PC) (I'm a horrible person. I know...but it's so much fun.)
- DayZ (PC) (it's rough but it's on the right track)
- The Wolf Among Us (PC) (Loved The Walking Dead. I have high hopes for Telltale on this one. Done through chapter 2. Looking good, if not weird so far. Reminds me of a lot of Max Payne 3. Waiting on Chapter 5.)
- Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon (PC) (Insanse.)
- Metro Last Light (PC) (A polished version of 2033. Much more interesting. Still think the sci-fi tie in is wonky. I'd rather deal with the human political side of the fallout. Sound is also hit and miss. Stealth element is simple, yet fun. Overall enjoyable after 2 hours in.  )
- Kentucky Route Zero (PC) (Beat acts I, II, and III. Getting crazy up in here. )
- Planetside 2 (PC) (I really didnt' think this game would be good. It is. It's also gorgeous for the most part)
- Arma III (PC) (A weird mix of awesome and horrible. I jump in here from time to time.)
- Starbound (PC) (Much better than Terraria.)
- GTA V (PS3) (It is what it is - a well polished, AAA monster of a game. You know the rest.)
- Minecraft (PC) (Started up a server again, then left it. Will probably revist it like I always do.)
- Starcraft 2 Heart of the Swarm (PC) (Recurring, but I still need to beat the campaign)
- Side Meier's Civilization V (PC) (Endless time sink. Just picked up Brave New World. Will revisit this and play a few games when not in school.)
- Godus (PC) (Want this to be good. I miss my Black and White)
- Fez (PC) (Have made good progress, just need to start it up again)
- Fable III (PC) (Lost a save, but want to finish this up. Restarting is rough)
- Dust: An Elysian Tail (PC) (Great sidescroller)
- Metro 2033 (PC) (Lost a save. Want to finish this, may get moved to abandoned depending on Last light's fun factor)
- Hitman Absolution (PC) (about 50% done. So much potential lost, but still a reasonable game)
- Monaco (PC) (I can't play this alone. It's just not quite as fun. Me finishing is dependant upon getting others to do so.)
- Rock of Ages (PC) 
- Shank 2 (PC) (Violent Side-scroller fun. )
- Monkey Island 2: Special Edition (PC/PS3) (I have to decide to play this on PC or PS3.)
- Darksiders 2 (PC) (Above average adventure. It's been a lot of fun. )
- Broken Sword 5 (PC) (Love me some point and click. I hope this one is no different.)
- Ni No Kuni (PS3) (I really want to like this. After a few hours the combat became really dry, and the story really shorted out quickly. I hear it picks up in the final 1/3 though. )
- Final Fantasy XIII-2 (PS3)
- L.A. Noire (PS3) (I'm a good 75% of the way through this. Just a few cases left on the last desk. I need to pick it up and finish it)
- Trine 2 (PC) (Absolutley classic if you can get 3 people together. Really want to finish up the DLC someday.)
- Prototype 2 (PC) (Monotonous, but sometimes fun. I just want to beat it and get it over with.)
- Papers Please (PC) (Ingenious little game. Both understated and underrated. Would love to beat this, but it's a little harsh on the learning curve.)
- Rust (PC) (A good DayZ clone which has potential. After dumping an initial 20 hours into this, I'm very hopeful about its future. It has a good base, but its potential is still up in the air depending on the dev team.)
